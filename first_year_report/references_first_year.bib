A Langevin equation is used to propagate the slowest degrees of freedom while minimizing the nearly instantaneous degrees of freedom. We present numerical results showing that time steps of up to 1000 fs can be used, with real speedups of up to 200 times over plain molecular dynamics. We present results of successfully folding the Fip35 mutant of WW domain.},

	abstract = {The expansion of theoretical chemistry and molecular modeling analysis has been assisted by advanced computational platforms. Computers not only can be used to solve complex chemical equations, but also to provide a suitable graphical viewer package to hypothetically visualize simulated operations and their output. Hence, computer technology proves to be an indispensable tool for carrying out molecular modeling operations. In fact, one can easily run such a job using the default values specified by the provider of a specific program. In order to interpret the outcome of a molecular modeling operation, one needs to have sufficient knowledge of the theoretical bases of the operations involved. In this chapter, we have attempted to provide some basics of different aspects of computational chemistry, where computer applications are crucial. In addition, we have provided the basic theoretical foundation involved in such processes, on the assumption that readers are novices in this field. With a clear conception of the theoretical bases, one can not only interpret the results of such modeling operations, but also modify the process variables in accordance with the needs in question. While certain processes might give appreciable results for certain groups of chemicals under defined criteria, it may be the case that other processes may fail or not even be applicable. Hence, readers are advised to achieve a basic theoretical insight of the molecular modeling operations in the light of computational algorithms instead of considering them a “black-box tool” for obtaining data.},

	abstract = {Determining the three-dimensional structure of a protein is required for studying its interactions, dynamics, structure-function relationship, and even inhibitor designing. Though protein structures have become essential for contemporary research, the gap between the available number of protein sequences and known protein structures is increasing exponentially. Apart from in vitro structural determination methods like NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and cryo-electron microscopy, several in silico methods are now available for predicting the structure of proteins. These methods have advanced by leaps and bounds in the past few decades owing to their potential applications in the field of biotechnology and medicine. Moreover, it is not the prediction but the validation and analysis of these predicted structures that form the core of protein modeling. This chapter explains how a protein structure can be modeled from scratch using in silico tools and further identify the best model through validation and refinement. Also, we highlight the technological advancements enabled by recent breakthroughs in this field. These tools, if used precisely, can provide valuable information in protein structure studies.},

The goal of ligand—protein docking is to predict the predominant binding mode(s) of a ligand with a protein of known three-dimensional structure. Successful docking methods search high-dimensional spaces effectively and use a scoring function that correctly ranks candidate dockings. Docking can be used to perform virtual screening on large libraries of compounds, rank the results, and propose structural hypotheses of how the ligands inhibit the target, which is invaluable in lead optimization. The setting up of the input structures for the docking is just as important as the docking itself, and analyzing the results of stochastic search methods can sometimes be unclear.

Besides the use of molecular docking methods to screen large chemical libraries and thus prioritize compounds for purchase or synthesis, more accurate calculations of protein–ligand binding free energy has shown the potential to guide lead optimization, thus saving time and resources. Theoretical developments and advances in computing power have allowed quantum mechanical-based methods applied to calculations on biomacromolecules to be increasingly explored and used, with the purpose of providing a more accurate description of protein–ligand interactions and an enhanced level of accuracy in the calculation of binding affinities. It should be noted that the quantum mechanical formulation includes, in principle, all contributions to the energy, considering terms usually neglected in molecular mechanics force fields, such as electronic polarization, metal coordination, and covalent binding; moreover, quantum mechanical approaches are systematically improvable. By treating all elements and interactions on equal footing, and avoiding the need of system-dependent parameterizations, they provide a greater degree of transferability. In this review, we illustrate the increasing relevance of quantum mechanical methods for binding free energy calculation in the context of structure-based drug lead optimization, showing representative applications of the different approaches available.},
