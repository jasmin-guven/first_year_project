	abstract = {One strategy employed by bacterial strains to resist β-lactam antibiotics is the expression of metallo-β-lactamases requiring Zn2+ for activity. In the last few years, many new zinc β-lactamases have been described and several pathogens are now known to synthesize members of this class. Metallo-β-lactamases are especially worrisome due to: (1) their broad activity profiles that encompass most β-lactam antibiotics, including the carbapenems; (2) potential for horizontal transference; and (3) the absence of clinically useful inhibitors. On the basis of the known sequences, three different lineages, identified as subclasses B1, B2, and B3 have been characterized. The three-dimensional structure of at least one metallo-β-lactamase of each subclass has been solved. These very similar 3D structures are characterized by the presence of an αββα-fold. In addition to metallo-β-lactamases which cleave the amide bond of the β-lactam ring, the metallo-β-lactamase superfamily includes enzymes which hydrolyze thiol-ester, phosphodiester and sulfuric ester bonds as well as oxydoreductases. Most of the 6000 members of this superfamily share five conserved motifs, the most characteristic being the His116-X-His118-X-Asp120-His121 signature. They all exhibit an αββα-fold, similar to that found in the structure of zinc β-lactamases. Many members of this superfamily are involved in mRNA maturation and DNA reparation. This fact suggests the hypothesis that metallo-β-lactamases may be the result of divergent evolution starting from an ancestral protein which did not have a β-lactamase activity.},

	abstract = {Bacteria carrying New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1 (New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase, NDM-1) resistance gene is a new type of “superbug”, which can hydrolyze almost all β-lactam antibiotics, rapidly spread among the same species and even spread among different species. NDM-1 belongs to the class B1 broad-spectrum enzyme of β-lactamase. The two positively charged zinc ions in the active center have electrostatic interaction with the hydroxyl ions in them to seize the hydrogen atom near the water molecule to form a bridging ring water molecule, which strengthens its nucleophilicity and attacks the carbonyl group on the lactam ring; thus, catalyzing the hydrolysis of β-lactam antibiotics. Since NDM-1 has an open active site and unique electrostatic structure, it essentially provides a wider range of substrate specificity. Due to its flexible hydrolysis mechanism and more and more variants also aggravate the threat of drug-resistant bacteria infection, there is still no effective inhibitor in clinic, which is a serious threat to human health and public health safety. The electron-rich substituents of NDM-1 inhibitors coordinate with two positively charged zinc ions in the active center of the enzyme through ion-dipole interaction to produce NDM-1 inhibitory activity. In this review, the research progress of NDM-1 enzyme and its inhibitors in the past 5 years was reviewed. The crystal structure, active center structure, surrounding important amino acid residues, newly discovered inhibitors and their action mechanism are classified and summarized in detail, which can be used as a reference for the development of effective drugs against drug-resistant bacteria targeting NDM-1.},

	abstract = {The New Delhi Metallo-β-lactamase (NDM-1) was first reported in 2009 in a Swedish patient. A recent study reported that Klebsiella pneumonia NDM-1 positive strain or Escherichia coli NDM-1 positive strain was highly resistant to all antibiotics tested except tigecycline and colistin. These can no longer be relied on to treat infections and therefore, NDM-1 now becomes potentially a major global health threat. In this study, we performed modeling studies to obtain its 3D structure and NDM-1/antibiotics complex. It revealed that the hydrolytic mechanisms are highly conserved. In addition, the detailed analysis indicates that the more flexible and hydrophobic loop1, together with the evolution of more positive-charged loop2 leads to NDM-1 positive strain more potent and extensive in antibiotics resistance compared with other MBLs. Furthermore, through biological experiments, we revealed the molecular basis for antibiotics catalysis of NDM-1 on the enzymatic level. We found that NDM-1 enzyme was highly potent to degrade carbapenem antibiotics, while mostly susceptible to tigecycline, which had the ability to slow down the hydrolysis velocity of meropenem by NDM-1. Meanwhile, the mutagenesis experiments, including D124A, C208A, K211A and K211E, which displayed down-regulation on meropenem catalysis, proved the accuracy of our model. At present, there are no effective antibiotics against NDM-1 positive pathogen. Our study will provide clues to investigate the molecular basis of extended antibiotics resistance of NDM-1 and then accelerate the search for new antibiotics against NDM-1 positive strain in clinical studies.},

	abstract = {Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae with resistance to carbapenem conferred by New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) are a type of newly discovered antibioticresistant bacteria. The rapid pandemic spread of NDM-1 bacteria worldwide (spreading to India, Pakistan, Europe, America, and Chinese Taiwan) in less than 2 months characterizes these microbes as a potentially major global health problem. The drug resistance of NDM-1 bacteria is largely due to plasmids containing the blaNDM-1 gene shuttling through bacterial populations. The NDM-1 enzyme encoded by the blaNDM-1 gene hydrolyzes β-lactam antibiotics, allowing the bacteria to escape the action of antibiotics. Although the biological functions and structural features of NDM-1 have been proposed according to results from functional and structural investigation of its homologues, the precise molecular characteristics and mechanism of action of NDM-1 have not been clarified. Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of NDM-1 with two catalytic zinc ions in its active site. Biological and mass spectroscopy results revealed that D-captopril can effectively inhibit the enzymatic activity of NDM-1 by binding to its active site with high binding affinity. The unique features concerning the primary sequence and structural conformation of the active site distinguish NDM-1 from other reported metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) and implicate its role in wide spectrum drug resistance. We also discuss the molecular mechanism of NDM-1 action and its essential role in the pandemic of drug-resistant NDM-1 bacteria. Our results will provide helpful information for future drug discovery targeting drug resistance caused by NDM-1 and related metallo-β-lactamases.},
